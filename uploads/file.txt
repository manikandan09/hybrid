Computational Private Information Retrieval (cPIR) protocols allow a client to retrieve one bit from a database, without the
server inferring any information about the queried bit. These protocols are too costly in practice because they invoke complex arithmetic
operations for every bit of the database. In this paper we present pCloud, a distributed system that constitutes the first attempt towards
practical cPIR. Our approach assumes a
